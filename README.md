Trying to combine https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-amplify-graphql and https://github.com/mwarger/amplify-auth-examples

1. `git clone`
1. \$ `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli` (If you don't already have amplify installed)
1. \$ `amplify configure` (If you haven't already configured amplify)
1. \$ `amplify init`
1. \$ `amplify add auth`
1. \$ `amplify add api`
1. \$ `amplify push`
1. \$ `yarn`
1. \$ `cp config.example.js config.js` And then put your FB app's ID in there
